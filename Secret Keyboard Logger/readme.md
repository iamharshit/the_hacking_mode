## Secret Keyboard Logger

#### Overview

A really simple program to secretly store all the key pressess on a computer without the knowledge of the user.

Program once started, runs in the background without any icon on taskbar - hence the person using the computer won't know at all that his data is being stored.Only way to find this is through the 'Task Manager'.

#### Motivation

An evil motivation...to know my friend's fb password when he uses my computer to log-in into his account.

#### Usage

1. To start it in `cmd` or `power shell` type: `run python main.py`.
2. To stop it and save the keyboard log press `shift+esc`.
3. Now a `log.txt` is created - open it and see all the key pressess untill now.
